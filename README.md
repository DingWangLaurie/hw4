# Task 1.1 
First, create a 1D array of size n, ranging values from -2 to 1. Then create  a 1D array of size n, ranging values form -1.5 to 1.5. After that, create the nxn grid between range [-2,1] * [-1.5,1.5]. Then store the c grid in z. Apply the hMandelbrot iteration for N_max steps. Later, create a 3D boolean matrix mask, which checks if the absolute value of z smaller than threshold. Then, call the mandelbrot function. At the end, plot and save the figure as mandelbrot.png.
# Task 1.2
First, create a random n-vector p and a random matrix P.Then, in the same way, use function NumPy and Matplotlib and For loop to get graph. This task serves to do power iteration repeatedly as it will converge to the eigenvector response, the largest eigenvalue. The largest eigenvector for this question’s Markov chain, the transition matrix, is one, and the eigenvector corresponds to the steady state.
